    "## Blood Volume relationship with vascular compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between **blood volume** and **vascular compliance** is fundamental in cardiovascular physiology because it determines how the circulatory system accommodates changes in blood volume without large fluctuations in pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vascular Compliance (C)**  \n",
    "    Compliance is defined as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   $\\Delta V$ = change in blood volume\n",
    "    *   $\\Delta P$ = change in pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "    High compliance means the vessel can accommodate a large change in volume with a small change in pressure. Low compliance means even small volume changes cause large pressure changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blood Volume and Pressure Relationship**\n",
    "    *   In **high-compliance vessels** (e.g., veins), adding blood volume causes only a slight increase in pressure. This is why veins act as a reservoir for blood.\n",
    "    *   In **low-compliance vessels** (e.g., arteries), even small increases in blood volume significantly raise pressure, which is critical for maintaining perfusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Physiological Implications**\n",
    "    *   **Veins**: \\~65% of blood volume is stored here because of their high compliance.\n",
    "    *   **Arteries**: Low compliance ensures that pressure remains high enough to drive blood flow to tissues.\n",
    "    *   **Pathology**: Reduced compliance (e.g., arterial stiffness in aging or hypertension) means that the same blood volume leads to higher pressures, increasing cardiac workload.\n",
